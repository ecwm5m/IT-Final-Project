**Listening to Music:**    
>Out of all my hobbies this is the one that I do the most. Most of the time on any given day I will have my headphones in listening to music. No matter what mood I'm in, happy, sad, angry, etc, I can always find myself listening to music. It's like my escape from reality so to speak.

**Playing video games:**
>Ever since I was little, I've always loved to play video games. Video games are a fun way to pass time and also develop crtitcal thinking skills, as I also enjoy the challenes they invite you to solve. Nowadays, I play games with my friends so it only adds to the experience.

**Watching TV/Anime:**
>As a kid I always had that basic enjoyment of TV from shows like spongebob and such. They were just a fun way to pass time. Now I can appreciate TV for the artistic elemements, characters and their development, and the emotional investment. I started watching anime in 2019 and it is dfeinitely a choice I don't regret. In my opinion I find anime to be more entertaining and emotionally investing than regular TV, and they really know how to immerse you in the worlds that they build. AT this point I may be what some call a _weeb_.

**Shoe Collecting:**
>This is something that I have only just _recently_ gotten into, but I really only got into fashion/clothes in high school but now as I've gotten older I have the ability to buy the things that I want and shoes are things that I enjoy buying and wearing.

**Recreational Sports:**
>I've always been pretty athletic and enjoyed playing sports. This is most likely because I am a competitive person so playing sports allows me to be competitive and have fun at the same time
