**Hanging with friends:**
>In highschool I made a lot of the friends that I would call family today. Hanging with them there is never really a dull moment and it's always a good time. 

**Listening to Music:**    
>Out of all my hobbies this is the one that I do the most. Most of the time on any given day I will have my headphones in listening to music. No matter what mood I'm in, happy, sad, angry, etc, I can always find myself listening to music. It's like my escape from reality so to speak.
